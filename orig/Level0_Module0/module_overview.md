Thinking logically is a key ingredient to becoming a well rounded programmer.  Below are a few examples of types of logical thinking.


Directions:
    -Read the summaries below on different types of logic.
    -In the next few lessons you will test your logical reasoning skills with some fun interactive questions.  Although you will not write any code in this module the lessons are written in python and you can view some of the syntax.

    

1. Deductive logic is like solving a puzzle where you start with some big clues and use them to figure out smaller details. Imagine you have a box of colorful building blocks, and someone tells you that inside the box, there are only red and blue blocks. You also know that all the red blocks are square. Now, if you find a square block in the box, you can deduce that it must be red because you know all square blocks are red. Deductive logic is a bit like being a detective, using what you already know to discover new things.


2. Inductive logic is like being an explorer who looks at specific things and then makes guesses about the bigger picture. Imagine you have a friend who always eats apples, and every time they eat an apple, they say it's yummy. So, you might think, "Hmm, if every time my friend eats an apple, they like it, maybe they like all kinds of fruit!" Inductive logic is about making general ideas based on the things you see around you. It's like connecting the dots between different clues to come up with a big idea or guess about how things might be.


3. Abductive logic is like playing detective and figuring out the best answer to a mystery. Imagine you come home and find your favorite cookies missing. Instead of knowing for sure who took them, you think about the clues. Maybe you see crumbs near your sister's room, and she's holding a cookie jar. You might guess that she took your cookies. Abductive logic is about using the clues to come up with the most likely explanation, even if you can't be 100% sure. It's like being a little detective and making the best guess based on the evidence you have.


4. Propositional logic is like playing with building blocks of ideas. Imagine you have different blocks with words like "happy," "sun," and "play." Each block represents a little idea. Now, if you say, "I am happy when the sun is out," you can connect the "happy" block with the "sun" block. Propositional logic is like putting these blocks together and saying things in a way that makes sense. You can use words like "and," "or," and "not" to build sentences with your blocks. For example, you can say, "I am happy when the sun is out, and I play outside." It's like creating stories by combining these building blocks of ideas in different ways.


These are just a few examples, there are many more specialized branches of logic.  In Programming the above 4 types are the most commonly used.
